# Clean and modern Elmish template

This is minimal F# Elmish template implementing simple counter using:

- F# 5
- Fable 3
- Esbuild
- Servør
- Elmish

The idea of template is to contain as few dependencies as possible, while still providing comfortable development experience.

## Install
To install run

```
yarn run init
```

## Development server
Servør is used for development server as it supports reloading on file change. This is similar to webpack-dev-server, but with much fewer dependencies.

To start server simply run

```

yarn serve
```

and go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Cleaning
To clean the working directory of files generated by fable and esbuild, run

```
yarn run clean
```

and to clean the working directory of all automatically generated files, leaving only the source code, run

```
yarn run purge
```
